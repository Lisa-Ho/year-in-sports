## How to use it

Export your data from Strava following [this guide](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export). Then upload the `activities.csv` file and select the year you want to visualise. 

If none of your activities include distance, you can select `N/A` as Distance unit and it won't get visualised. 

The output will look something like this.
